### Emails

Emails can be edited with limited programming experience and some familiarity with either GitHub or Git.

#### Create a new email

1.  If the incident occurred in a city that is not yet published, create a new folder in the `templates` folder. Name this folder based on the location of the incident. For example, if the incident happened in the city `gotham` and you named the folder gotham, it would create a new link at http://boost.avoice.info/gotham. Otherwise, skip this step.
2.  Add a new `txt` file to the folder named after the city where the incident occurred. Your content will have to follow the structure below:

    ```
    TITLE: title/person we want to contact
    EMAIL: email we want to send to
    SUBJECT_LINE: The subject line of the email
    BODY:
    The text of the email goes here
    ```

3.  You can add the following variables to your email body and subject line, as well:
    -   `${firstName}` - The form-filler's first name
    -   `${city}` - The city the form-filler is from
    -   `${region}` - The state (if within the USA) or country the form-filler is from
