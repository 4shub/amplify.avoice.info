This project began as a way to demand justice for George Floyd, a Black man murdered in cold blood by four cops in the Minneapolis Police Department. It has now expanded to support others affected by injustice.

### Emails

Emails can be edited with limited programming experience and some familiarity with either GitHub or Git.

#### Create a new email

1.  If the incident occurred in a city that is not yet published, create a new folder in the `templates` folder. Name this folder based on the location of the incident. For example, if the incident happened in the city `gotham` and you named the folder gotham, it would create a new link at http://boost.avoice.info/gotham. Otherwise, skip this step. Please place all local initiatives within the `local` folder in `templates.
2. (Optional) Create a file called `METADATA` in your folder to control the title and summary of this initative. Use the following structure:
    ```
    TITLE: The title of your initiative, will default to #blacklivesmatter if not included
    SUMMARY:
    Summary/description of your initiative goes here. This will default to the text seen on `https://boost.avoice.info/minneapolis` if not included.
   ```
   
3.  Add a new `txt` file to the folder named after the city where the incident occurred. Your content will have to follow the structure below:

    ```
    TITLE: title/person we want to contact
    EMAIL: email we want to send to
    SUBJECT_LINE: The subject line of the email
    BODY:
    The text of the email goes here
    ```

4.  You can add the following variables to your email body and subject line, as well:
    -   `${firstName}` - The form-filler's first name
    -   `${city}` - The city the form-filler is from
    -   `${region}` - The state (if within the USA) or country the form-filler is from
    -   `${lastName}` - The form-filler's last name (Warning, this is an optional field and will not always be entered in)
5.  Once you're done, you can create a pull request for this repository and we'll review it!
    - Keep emails under 4000 characters long or the gmail link will not work. If you submit an email that long we will hide the "send with Gmail" option.
