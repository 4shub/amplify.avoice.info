SUBJECT_LINE: I, ${firstName}, demand justice for George Floyd
BODY:
Attorney General Ellison,

My name is ${firstName}${lastName}. I live in ${city}, ${region}, but I am appalled enough about recent events in Minneapolis to take the time to write in.

I am demanding justice for George Floyd, a Black man who was murdered in cold blood by four Minneapolis Police Department officers on May 25, 2020. This incident was caught on video by multiple sources, including but not limited to the one linked, all of which clearly prove the guilt of the officers in question.

I am appreciative that all four of the officers involved were charged, and additionally, that you have increased charges against Derek Chauvin to a 2nd degree murder; however, justice for George Floyd will not be served until these officers are convicted appropriately for their crimes. It is imperative that the court sees this case for what it is: an unwarranted and racially-motivated murder.

Unfortunately, while convictions for these officers is a great first step, it is not nearly enoughâ€”racially-motivated crimes like these are not isolated incidents. Racial prejudice is deeply rooted in the criminal justice system, and it takes systemic change to decrease the prevalence of racially-motivated violence on civilians by police officers. Please keep this in mind as you preside over the George Floyd case, and take this to heart as you continue to serve as Attorney General for the state of Minnesota. 

I appreciate your consideration of these topics, and trust that you and the jury will do the right thing.

Sincerely,
${firstName}${lastName}
