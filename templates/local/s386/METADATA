SUMMARY: Immigrants entering the US through a work visa have the opportunity to apply for a green card or permanent residency. However, the problem is these green cards are issued on the basis of an applicant's nation of origin. Each country, regardless of how many immigrants are each allotted 7% of all employment-based green cards. This has created a system where a smaller nation like Switzerland is issued the same amount of green cards as a much larger country like India, creating much longer wait times for immigrants from larger countries. This has resulted in up to 150 years of wait times for over 1 million Indian and Chinese immigrants & families to get green cards. Over 60,000 backlogged immigrant children who have grown up in the United States could face deportation when they are 21 when their visa becomes invalid. Bill S386 aims to eliminate this per-country cap, protect these children from deportation, and reduce the wait times as a result of the green card backlog. Bill S386 has overwhelmingly bipartisan support, however only Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, who was lobbied by anti-immigrant groups, is currently blocking this bill from passing. Public pressure on Senator Durbin has been working and with your support, we can pass this bill!
