SUBJECT_LINE: Passing Bill S386

BODY:
Dear Senator Durbin,

I am ${firstName}${lastName} from ${city}, ${region}, and I am writing to you because I have learned that you are blocking bill S386 that will create a more fair and equal immigration system and help so many immigrant children from aging-out. ABIC, or Action for Backlogged Immigrant Children, are a group of backlogged immigrant children who have brought this to my attention through their viral social media posts and videos about your block on this bill. Please work with Senator Lee to pass this bill rather than blocking it. I will keep spreading news of this issue to Illinoisans until the bill is passed.

​
In 2011, you co-sponsored a very similar bill, S1983, so why are you currently blocking bill S386? If your intentions are to help the over 60,000 children who will potentially age-out of the system, Bill S386 does that better than the bill you proposed as it allows these children to stay in the US, work, and receive scholarships and financial aid. Instead of proposing your own legislation, work to pass S386. Stop using these immigrant children for your own political gain. This is absolutely not okay, and I am urging you to please work with Senator Mike Lee to negotiate and pass bill S386 as it is the most bipartisan and pragmatic solution to making a green card.

​
Thank you for your time,
${firstName}${lastName}
